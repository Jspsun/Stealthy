# Stealthy
Another Java game that I made

Probably one of my first "major" projects in high school. Stealthy was my take on [Starcraft](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/) meets [Leauge of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) meets [Portal](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/).

The general goal of the game is to progress through a somewhat story-driven level. You control a little sprite that has to navigate through mazes, traps and death robots. The player can teleport, go invisible, attack and use special attacks.

I used Pokemon as the guiding voice for my sprites. Oh man it took so long to make them match art styles. Anyways, if you feel like taking a look, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
